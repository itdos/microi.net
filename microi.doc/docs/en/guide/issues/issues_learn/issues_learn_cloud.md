# Operation and Maintenance Tutorial

## Introduction

Cloud Native is a modern approach to software development and deployment designed to take full advantage of cloud computing and improve application scalability, elasticity, and reliability.

::: tip Cloud Native Definition

Cloud-native technologies enable organizations to build and run elastically scalable applications in new dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Representative cloud-native technologies include containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and explicit APIs. These techniques enable the construction of loosely coupled systems that are fault-tolerant, easy to manage and easy to observe. Combined with reliable automation, cloud-native technology enables engineers to easily make frequent and predictable major changes to the system.
